## 🎯 Overview

The **EU AI Act** (Regulation 2024/1689) entered into force on 1 August 2024 and applies progressively through 2027. It introduces a **risk-based framework** requiring organisations to identify where their AI systems fall on the risk spectrum — with consequences ranging from outright prohibition to specific documentation and audit obligations.

This tool uses **Claude (Anthropic)** as a reasoning engine to:

1. Parse a natural-language description of an AI system
2. Map it against the EU AI Act framework (Articles 5, 6, 51-56, Annex II, Annex III)
3. Return a structured classification with legal basis, obligations, and next steps

Built for **legal, compliance, and product teams** who need rapid, reasoned risk assessments — without manually cross-referencing 144 pages of regulation.

## 📖 Usage

### Single Classification

```bash
# Basic
python classifier.py -d "Description of your AI system"

# Save JSON report
python classifier.py -d "Credit scoring model for mortgage applications" --output report.json

# Verbose (shows API call details)
python classifier.py -d "..." --verbose
```

### Interactive Mode

```bash
python classifier.py --interactive
# Enter descriptions one by one, get classifications in real time
# Type 'quit' to exit

---

## 📦 Batch Classification

Classify multiple AI systems from a **CSV** or **JSON** file.

### CSV Format

```csv
name,description
HR Screening Tool,AI that ranks job applicants based on CV data and predicted performance
Customer Chatbot,Conversational AI that answers product questions on a website
Credit Scoring Engine,ML model assessing creditworthiness of individual loan applicants
```

### Run Batch

```bash
# Basic batch
python batch_classifier.py -i examples/sample_systems.csv -o results.json

# With CSV summary export
python batch_classifier.py -i examples/sample_systems.csv -o results.json --csv summary.csv

# Custom delay between API calls (default: 1.5s)
python batch_classifier.py -i systems.json --delay 2.0
```
